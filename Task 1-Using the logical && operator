//Create a variable named  score and set it to  8

//Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and compares the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator

//The expected output in the console should be: "Mid-level skills: true".

//Solution:
var score = 8;
console.log("Mid-level-skills" , score > 0 && score <10);
